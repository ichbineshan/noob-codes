Get your eyes on some easy codes which can be translated into effective programs with slight modification.
The REPO- consists of .py file codes and .exe files which have been made using the pyinstaller external 
module and are sufficient for high school level projects....

COMMENTED alternative codes and their explanation.


NOTE- if you directly execute the .py files in the black window, then they would close after showing output
in the tiniest of a second giving an illusion that file isnt running, so to do it that way,
edit the .py file and add xyz=input("Press enter to quit") and now the program waits long enough 
for you to read and then quit..
